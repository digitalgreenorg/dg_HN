This is a weekly automated email to monitor non-negotiables entry.

Non-negotiables were made mandatory in COCO video form from July. It is important to ensure that correct non-negotiables are being entered by partners. They can also be modified in COCO Admin by DG staff. We hope to show non-negotiables on the website and downloadable cheat sheets next to the corresponding video. 

Please ensure high quality of data entry for Non-negotiables from your respective region.

Thank you for your support!

Tech team
